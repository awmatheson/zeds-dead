    "body": "2020/03/13 -           Context : Recently Boston became a COVID19 hotspot due to an outbreak occurring at biogen. This happens to be a company located approximately 2 blocks from my apartment. We share restaurants, transit hubs and more. Since this hits a little close to home, I wanted to take a look at the suspected growth rate for the total possible number of infected people in the boston area. To do this, we will use the SIR model and we can also create a forecasting model using prophet to track the predicted vs. actual.              #collapse-hideimport pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib. pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snsimport matplotlib. dates as mdatesfrom sklearn. cluster import KMeansimport datetimefrom datetime import date, timedeltafrom fbprophet import Prophetfrom datetime import datetimeimport requestsfrom io import StringIO             bytes_csv = str(requests. get(&quot;https://raw. githubusercontent. com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_19-covid-Confirmed. csv&quot;, allow_redirects=True). content,&#39;utf-8&#39;)data = StringIO(bytes_csv) df=pd. read_csv(data, parse_dates=True)df. dropna(inplace=True)df = df[df[&#39;Province/State&#39;]. str. contains(&#39;Massachusetts&#39;)]. iloc[:,4:]. copy().

We will make some assumptions around the population because it is most likely feasible that only certain mobile areas of the greater boston population would be affected. In addition, since schools have closed and work from home is already mandated, we can probably further reduce our contact rate to the lower of the range shown for the coronavirus.       population = 4875390saturation_coeff = . 6 # estimated possible population saturationdensity_coeff=. 5 # 1/2 of wuhan density    Using the SIR model to determine growth recovery rate, gamma = 1/5 - 1 person takes on average 5 days to pass through the contagious stage 1contact rate, beta = . 475 - This is difficult because it varies over time 2. This complicates things, since the early contact rate could be up to 10, but will decrease as restrictions are placed on the population, people self-isolate etc. For this estimation we will assume a contact rate of 0. 5 after fitting the SIR to the Italy EDA I previously completed here. Approximately 15% of cases require hospitalization based on the China outbreak and 5% require ICU treatment 3Massachusetts has 15,193 beds available and approximately operate at 50% capacity - leaving ~7597 beds. 4population adjusted is based on the estimation that sparser populated areas do not have as high of transmission rates and can be fairly isolated from the rest of the population.              #collapse-showimport numpy as npfrom scipy. integrate import odeintimport matplotlib. pyplot as plt# Total population adjusted for assumptions listed aboveN = population * saturation_coeff * density_coeffhosp_rate= 0. 15# Initial number of infected and recovered individuals, I0 and R0.

We will run out of bed capacity eventually, which is the situation that happened in Italy. Without the ability to build massize isolated treatment centers like china did, there are not many options for creating hospitals that will have the necessary treatment capabilities for the virus. Lets zoom in on the capacity below.       # Zooming infig = plt. figure(facecolor=&#39;w&#39;, figsize= (14,10))ax = fig. add_subplot(111, axisbelow=True)ax. plot(t, H/1000, &#39;y&#39;, alpha=0. 5, lw=2, label=&#39;Hospitalized&#39;)ax. plot(t, beds/1000, &#39;m&#39;, alpha=0. 5, lw=2, label=&#39;Bed Capacity&#39;)ax. text(t[23], 8, &quot;Hospital Saturation&quot;, ha=&#39;center&#39;)ax. set_xlabel(&#39;Time /days&#39;)ax. set_ylabel(&#39;Number (1000s)&#39;)ax. set_ylim(0,70)ax. set_xlim(0,60)ax. yaxis. set_tick_params(length=0)ax. xaxis. set_tick_params(length=0)ax. grid(b=True, which=&#39;major&#39;, c=&#39;w&#39;, lw=2, ls=&#39;-&#39;)legend = ax. legend()legend. get_frame(). set_alpha(0. 5)for spine in (&#39;top&#39;, &#39;right&#39;, &#39;bottom&#39;, &#39;left&#39;):  ax. spines[spine]. set_visible(False)plt. show()    Conclusion : The visualization above shows that approximately 23-25 days after the initial group of patients tested positive, we could reach hospital bed saturation for Massachusetts based off of the greater boston population (adjusted) being infected by the virus. This could cause a change in the contact rate that we assumed for our model and increase the infected patients. Based on this analysis, we could see deaths into the 10s of thousands in the next few months depending on the demographics of the population infected.
